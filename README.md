# Would You Rather?

Would You Rather? is a game about choice. Log in, answer questions and make your own questions!

## Starting the application

-   Install yarn.
-   Navigate to the repo.
-   Run `yarn install`.
-   Run `yarn start`.

## Development

While you're running the server, feel free to adjust the files. The server files will be updated automatically and you'll see the changes in the browser.

## Deployment

When you commit the code will be built and deployed automatically. This git hook can be configured in `package.json`.

### Manual deployment

-   Configure your GitHub site in `package.json`.
-   Run `yarn run deploy` to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
